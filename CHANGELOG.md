## [0.1.8] - 2026-03-10

### Changed
- Refactored pattern compilation to support multiple sources for proper global+agent pattern merging
- Simplified `wildcard-matcher.ts` by removing unused `wildcardCount` and `literalLength` properties
- `BashFilter` now accepts pre-compiled patterns via `BashPermissionSource` type
- Replaced `compilePermissionPatterns` with `compilePermissionPatternsFromSources` for cleaner API

### Fixed
- Permission pattern priority now correctly implements last-match-wins hierarchy (opencode-style)
- MCP tool-level deny no longer blocks specific MCP allow patterns

### Tests
- Updated tests to reflect last-match-wins behavior
- Added test for specific MCP rules winning over `tools.mcp: deny`
- Rearranged test pattern declarations for clarity

## [0.1.7] - 2026-03-10

### Added
- `src/common.ts` — Shared utility module with `toRecord()`, `getNonEmptyString()`, `isPermissionState()`, `parseSimpleYamlMap()`, `extractFrontmatter()`
- `src/wildcard-matcher.ts` — Wildcard pattern compilation and matching with specificity sorting
- File stamp caching in `PermissionManager` for improved performance
- `tools.mcp` fallback permission for MCP operations
- MCP tool permission targets now inferred from configured server names in `mcp.json`

### Changed
- Refactored `bash-filter.ts` to use shared `wildcard-matcher.ts` module
- Refactored `index.ts` to use shared `common.ts` utilities
- Refactored `permission-manager.ts` to use shared modules and caching
- Pre-compiled wildcard patterns are now reused across permission checks
- Updated README architecture documentation to reflect new module organization

### Tests
- Added tests for MCP proxy tool inferring server-prefixed aliases from configured server names
- Added tests for `tools.mcp` fallback behavior
- Added tests for `task` using tool permissions instead of MCP fallback

## [0.1.6] - 2026-03-09

### Added
- Sanitized the `Available tools:` system prompt section so denied tools are removed before the agent starts.

### Changed
- Updated README documentation to describe system-prompt tool sanitization and refreshed the displayed package version.

### Fixed
- Prevented hidden tools from remaining advertised in the startup system prompt after runtime tool filtering.

## [0.1.5] - 2026-03-09

### Changed
- Added `repository`, `homepage`, and `bugs` package metadata so npm links back to the public GitHub repository and issue tracker.

## [0.1.4] - 2026-03-07

### Added
- Added permission request forwarding so non-UI subagent sessions can surface `ask` confirmations back to the main interactive session.
- Added filesystem-based request/response handling for both primary and legacy permission-forwarding directories.

### Changed
- Updated README documentation to describe subagent permission forwarding behavior and current architecture responsibilities.
- Added `package-lock.json` to the repository for reproducible local installs.

### Fixed
- Preserved interactive `ask` permission flows for delegated subagents that would otherwise fail without direct UI access.
- Improved cleanup and compatibility handling around legacy permission-forwarding directories.

## [0.1.3] - 2026-03-04

### Fixed
- Use absolute GitHub raw URL for README image to fix npm display

## [0.1.2] - 2026-03-04

### Changed
- Rewrote README.md with professional documentation standards
- Added comprehensive feature documentation, configuration reference, and usage examples

## [0.1.1] - 2026-03-02

### Changed
- Added `asset/` to the npm package `files` whitelist so README image assets are included in tarballs.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-03-02

### Changed
- Reorganized repository structure to match standard extension layout:
  - moved implementation and tests into `src/`
  - added root `index.ts` shim for Pi auto-discovery
  - standardized TypeScript project settings with Bundler module resolution
- Added package distribution metadata and scripts, including `pi.extensions` and publish file whitelist.
- Added repository scaffolding files (`README.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`, `LICENSE`, `.gitignore`, `.npmignore`) and config starter template.

### Preserved
- Global permission config path semantics remained `~/.pi/agent/pi-permissions.jsonc`.
- Permission schema location remained `schemas/permissions.schema.json`.
- Permission enforcement behavior remained intact.
